### Prerequisites
- **Rust** (latest stable version recommended)
- **OpenAI API Key** - Get yours from [OpenAI's website](https://openai.com/api/)

### Installation & Running

#### Using OpenAI
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai_dventure.git
cd ai_dventure

# Run with your API key
cargo run -- --api-key <YOUR_API_KEY>

# Or set it as an environment variable

#### Using Local OLLAMA
```bash
# Make sure OLLAMA is running locally
# Install from: https://ollama.ai

# Pull a model (if not already done)
ollama pull llama3

# Run the game with OLLAMA
cargo run -- --base-url http://localhost:11434/v1 --model llama3

# Or with environment variable
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
cargo run -- --model llama3

# Try other models
cargo run -- --base-url http://localhost:11434/v1 --model mistral
cargo run -- --base-url http://localhost:11434/v1 --model codellama

## Example Gameplay
```
=== ADVENTURE BEGINS ===
You stand at the gates of a mysterious ancient castle. The wind howls through 
the twisted iron bars, and the pale moon casts eerie shadows across the 
crumbling stone walls. A faint light flickers in one of the tower windows.

Available choices:
1. Push open the heavy castle gates and enter
2. Circle around to find another entrance
3. Call out to whoever might be in the tower
4. Search the surrounding area for clues

What do you do? (type your choice or 'quit' to exit): I examine the gates for traps
```

## Requirements
- Rust
- OpenAI API key (ENV variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`) - or local OLLAMA installation

## Command line arguments
The application accepts the following parameters:
- `--api-key`: specify custom key if not defined in env (optional for local endpoints like OLLAMA)
- `--model`: choose model name (e.g. `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `llama3`, `mistral`, etc.). If not specified `gpt-4o-mini` is used
- `--base-url`: specify custom API base URL (ENV variable `OPENAI_BASE_URL`). Default: `https://api.openai.com/v1`

Example:
```bash
# Run in development mode with OpenAI
cargo run

# With OpenAI parameters
cargo run -- --api-key <YOUR_API_KEY> --model gpt-4o-mini

# With local OLLAMA endpoint
cargo run -- --base-url http://localhost:11434/v1 --model llama3

# Using environment variables for OLLAMA
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
cargo run -- --model llama3

# Build a release binary
cargo build --release

# Run the release binary with OLLAMA
./target/release/ai_dventure --base-url http://localhost:11434/v1 --model llama3
